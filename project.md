        It all started when we had the chance to meet what is probably the greatest Dutch journalist, brilliant war reporter, rock & roll, cause driven, Ingeborg Beugel.
        Married to the right hand of the former Greek Minister of culture, well introduced in the world of art, living in Athens, she told us something fascinating: “Culture in Athens has never been as dynamic since the crisis.”
        Artists, cinema and writers shine internationally, galleries and collectives abound. The city is attracting artists from London, Paris, Brussels, even New York come to Athens and do art. This, during the worst economic recession seen in a European country since the 30s. 
        This documentary will present the current Athenian art scene and seek the role the crisis had in shaping it.
