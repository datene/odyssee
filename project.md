        Athens Live
      </h2>
      <p class="text-block">
        A cultural dynamic is shaking Athenian's ground. We all read that Greece was suffering, did you know that it is living too? Here, suffering promotes solidarity and the quest for meaning. Collectives emerges, artistic expression is felt everywhere. Emigrated Athenians are coming back, international artists are immigrating in. A dynamic felt by the art exhibition documenta, which decided to move out of Germany for the very first time. Out of interviewing key actors, this movie dives deep into this vibrant ecosystem. Athens Live exposes this message of passion, shows that from difficulty can arise beauty.
